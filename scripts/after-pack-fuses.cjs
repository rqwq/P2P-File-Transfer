// electron-builder afterPack hook: flips Electron fuses on the packaged exe.
// These close the cheap tamper/bypass routes for release builds:
//   - EnableEmbeddedAsarIntegrityValidation: the exe refuses to run when
//     app.asar was modified (electron-builder embeds its expected hash).
//   - OnlyLoadAppFromAsar: no loading a replaced app from loose files.
//   - RunAsNode / NODE_OPTIONS / --inspect off: the shipped binary can't be
//     repurposed to run someone else's JS or be debugged into it.
// Dev builds (npm run dev) are untouched — fuses only apply to packaged exes.
// NOTE: fuse options go at the TOP LEVEL keyed by the FuseV1Options enum —
// nesting them under [FuseVersion.V1] is silently misread by the library.
//
// KNOWN GAP (spec 12.2, deliberate): native modules pulled in by
// Hyperswarm's dependency tree (sodium-native) and better-sqlite3 are
// asarUnpack-ed and therefore sit OUTSIDE app.asar — the asar-integrity
// fuse cannot cover them. This is a documented threat-model gap, not
// something to paper over.
